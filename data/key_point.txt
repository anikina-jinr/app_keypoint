The considered behavioral test has a form of round arena with the chequered-marked sectors and holes. 
The observation procedure on the laboratory animals takes 3-6 minutes. 

The “Open Field” test-system allows to register the general activity of animals. 
To this aim, we fix the quantity of passed sectors together with the number of intersections of the marked center. 
Also, we check how many holes, standings upright with/without supports, standings still and motions on one place the animals did.
